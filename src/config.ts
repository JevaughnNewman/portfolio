  aboutMe: `I’m a data analyst with nearly six years in insurance, specializing in accident benefits and complex claims. Using SQL, Power BI, Excel, Tableau, and Python, I transform complex claims data into actionable insights that reduce costs, enhance operational efficiency, and inform strategic decisions.

I design scalable analytics solutions and interactive dashboards to monitor reserve trends and claims leakage, enabling faster, data-driven decision-making within highly regulated environments.

As a mentor to junior adjusters, I promote team development and clear communication across legal, finance, and operations. Certified as a Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Associate, I combine deep industry knowledge with technical expertise to drive measurable business results.

I’m excited to contribute to a data-driven team where my analytical skills and insurance experience create real impact. Let’s connect to explore opportunities.`,
